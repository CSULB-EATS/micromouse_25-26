# üê≠ CSULB Micromouse ‚Äì Quick Setup (Reference Repo)

Welcome to the **Micromouse setup repository!**  
This repository is meant to serve as a **reference hub** for all CSULB Micromouse teams working with the **STM32Cube platform**.  
You‚Äôll find example projects, configuration files, and build instructions to help you get started quickly.

## üì¢ Important Notice

**Do not clone this repository directly to make edits.**  
Instead, **fork** it to your own GitHub account if you want to experiment or build on top of it.  

> The main organization repo is for **reference only** ‚Äî no changes should be pushed here.

If you just want to browse or copy code snippets, cloning or downloading is fine.  
But for active development, **each team should maintain its own fork or private repo** based on this template.

## üß≠ What‚Äôs Inside

This repository includes reference materials and example setups for:
- **STM32CubeIDE** project templates  
- **Example code** and older team projects  
- **Peripheral setup samples** (ADC, PWM, UART, timers, sensors, and motors)  
- **Pin configuration examples** (`.ioc` files)  
- **Starter code for motion control and maze solving**

These examples are meant to help your team **understand structure and best practices** for STM32-based Micromouse development.
